1. The program has been tested on RMIT's server properly

	1. No warnings or errors when compiling

	2. All functions are accomplished.

	3. All features/requirements should be working well, 
		but there might be some potential bugs or errors that I have not discovered.

	4. Additional fuction:

		1. PrintMenu() -- in 'helpers.c', called in main function to print the main menu,
			prototype defined in helpers.h

		2. BOOLEAN validSpace(int col, enum cell_contents board[][BOARDWIDTH])
			-- in player.c, to test if empty place in selected column.
			prototype defined in player.h
